This integration is based on [davidramosweb/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-time-based](https://github.com/davidramosweb/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-time-based/).

It improves the original integration by adding tilt control.

**Features:**

- Control the height of your cover based on time.
- Control the tilt of your cover based on time.

*To enable tilt control you need to add the `tilting_time_down` and `tilting_time_up` options to your configuration.yaml.*

## Install

### HACS
